# AI Analysis Grade-Based Field Mapping Implementation

## Overview
Successfully implemented grade-based field label mapping for AI analysis to ensure correct indicator labels are displayed based on student grade levels.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Grade-Based Field Sources
- **Grades 1-3**: Uses `master_fields_123.indicator` field
- **Grades 4-6**: Uses `master_fields.indicator_sub` field

### 2. Files Modified

#### `/app/api/ai/analyze/route.ts`
- Added logic to fetch from `master_fields_123` table for grades 1-3 using raw SQL query
- Maintains existing logic for grades 4-6 using `master_fields` table
- Enriches observation data with correct master fields before AI analysis

```typescript
// For grades 1-3
if (grade && ['1', '2', '3'].includes(grade.toString())) {
  const masterFields123 = await prisma.$queryRaw`
    SELECT id, indicator, grade, level 
    FROM master_fields_123 
    WHERE grade = ${`G${grade}`}
    ORDER BY id
  `;
  // Transform and use indicator field
}
```

#### `/lib/ai/gemini-client.ts`
- Updated `processEvaluationWithIndicators` function to determine correct indicator field based on grade
- Modified fallback analysis function `generateFallbackAnalysis` with same grade-based logic
- Ensures consistent field mapping throughout AI analysis process

```typescript
const isGrade123 = ['1', '2', '3'].includes(grade.toString());
fieldMap[sequence] = {
  indicator: isGrade123 
    ? (record.field.indicatorMain || record.field.indicatorSub)
    : record.field.indicatorSub,
  value: record.scoreValue
};
```

### 3. Key Features
- **Automatic Grade Detection**: System automatically determines which field source to use based on observation grade
- **Fallback Handling**: If primary indicator field is not available, system falls back to alternative field
- **Caching Support**: AI analysis results are cached with correct field mappings to avoid regeneration
- **Backward Compatibility**: Maintains support for existing observations while implementing new field mapping

### 4. Database Schema
- `master_fields_123` table: Contains indicators for grades 1-3 with `indicator` field
- `master_fields` table: Contains indicators for grades 4-6 with `indicator_sub` field
- `ai_analysis_results` table: Stores cached AI analysis with proper field references

### 5. Testing & Verification
Created verification scripts:
- `verify-field-mapping.js`: Verifies database field mapping configuration
- `test-ai-field-mapping.js`: Tests AI analysis API with different grade levels

### 6. API Endpoints Affected
- `POST /api/ai/analyze`: Main AI analysis endpoint with grade-based field fetching
- `GET /api/observations/[id]`: Returns observation with AI analysis including correct field labels
- `GET /api/observations/[id]/analysis`: Retrieves cached AI analysis

## Usage Example
When an AI analysis is requested for an observation:
1. System checks the grade level of the observation
2. For grades 1-3: Fetches indicators from `master_fields_123.indicator`
3. For grades 4-6: Fetches indicators from `master_fields.indicator_sub`
4. AI generates analysis using correct field labels
5. Results are cached for future retrieval

## Benefits
- **Accuracy**: Ensures correct educational indicators are displayed for each grade level
- **Performance**: Cached results prevent unnecessary AI regeneration
- **Maintainability**: Clear separation of grade-based logic
- **User Experience**: Teachers see appropriate field labels for their grade level

## Future Considerations
- Monitor AI analysis quality with different field mappings
- Consider adding grade 7+ support if needed
- Potential for customizable field mapping per school/district
