# Deployment Status & Instructions

## Current Issues

### 1. Browser Alert Still Showing on Production
**Issue**: The production site (mentor.openplp.com) is still showing browser alerts instead of toast notifications.

**Reason**: The latest code with toast notifications has been pushed to GitHub but hasn't been deployed to Vercel yet.

**Solution**: 
- Check Vercel dashboard at https://vercel.com
- Verify if auto-deployment is enabled for the main branch
- If deployment failed, check build logs
- If no auto-deploy, manually trigger a new deployment

### 2. Profile Page Error Display
**Status**: âœ… Fixed locally
- Improved error display with better UI
- Added retry button with proper styling
- Better error messaging in both Khmer and English

  - `/components/Toast.module.css` (new)
  - `/app/dashboard/observations/[id]/edit/page.tsx`
  - `/app/dashboard/observations/new/page.tsx`

### Profile Page Improvements (Latest)

## How to Deploy to Production

### Option 1: Auto-Deploy (Recommended)
1. Go to [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
2. Select your project (plp-456 or mentor)
3. Check if auto-deploy is enabled for the main branch
4. If enabled, deployment should happen automatically after git push

### Option 2: Manual Deploy
1. Go to [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
2. Select your project
3. Click "Deployments" tab
4. Click "Redeploy" on the latest commit
5. Wait for build to complete (usually 2-3 minutes)

### Option 3: Force Redeploy via Git
```bash
# Create an empty commit to trigger deployment
git commit --allow-empty -m "Trigger Vercel deployment"
git push origin main
```

## Verify Deployment Success

After deployment completes:

1. **Check Toast Notifications**:
   - Go to https://mentor.openplp.com/dashboard/observations/[any-id]/edit
   - Click Save/Update
   - Should see beautiful toast notification instead of browser alert

2. **Check Profile Page**:
   - Go to https://mentor.openplp.com/dashboard/profile
   - If error occurs, should see improved error UI
   - Retry button should have proper styling

## Build Status Check

To verify if the build is successful:
```bash
npm run build
```

If build succeeds locally, it should work on Vercel.

## Environment Variables

Ensure these are set in Vercel:
- DATABASE_URL
- NEXTAUTH_SECRET
- NEXTAUTH_URL (should be https://mentor.openplp.com)
- JWT_SECRET
- All other env variables from .env.local

## Support

If deployment issues persist:
1. Check Vercel build logs for errors
2. Ensure all environment variables are set
3. Verify GitHub integration is working
4. Check if there are any TypeScript errors: `npm run type-check`
